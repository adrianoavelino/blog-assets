## Introduction
This is a practical guide that aims to teach a person with zero programming experience how to become a professional JavaScript developer/engineer.

More than JavaScript, we will go through a variety of topics that are necessary for all kind of (web) developers, like Software Engineering, Testing, Web Design, etc.

This knowledge will empower us to create professional applications and solid open source projects.

> If you are a book person, you can find the book version of this guide **[here]()**.

## Motivation
It is really hard to learn a new skill alone. One of the worst things about learn something by ourselves is the high probability of doing things in the wrong way, in a totally amateur way, without any help or anyone to show us "the right way" to do such tasks.

Another thing that is even more hard for any newbie in any new field is how to figure out what need to be learned, what are the basic skills that will give the biggest results (Pareto principle), what is the correct order of topics that need to be learned.

I already started to learn some abilities by myself: drawing, music (guitar) and programming to name a few.

Looking back, I really don't know how I had the courage to start and keep doing these activities, and I feel scared just to think how easy it is to giving up to learn something new not because we don't have the capacity, but because the new topic to be learned is a whole new world, and this is definitely a scary and overwhelming thing.

To help people that want to join this amazing world of programming, I will do my best to flatten the path that needs to be traveled on that journey that will still be challenging, but I hope that a more feasible one.

I'm also traveling on this road, and one of the best ways to internalize any topic is to teach it to someone else, so this is another motivation for that project.

> The important thing is not the arrival, but the path traveled. **Enjoy the journey!**

## Audience
If you identify with one of the following "personas", this guide will be valuable and interesting for you:

- I am a creative person, with lots of cool ideas in mind, willing to pursue the necessary knowledge (programming skills) to implement my ideas.
- I am already a developer but I really want to master JavaScript development, being able to understand under the hood libraries and projects that I use day to day, and also be able to create that kind of software.
- I am a developer that wants to have a deep understand about architectures, patterns, processes - concepts in general - to always start my personal and professional projects in a solid and well structured way.
- I am a kind of person that prefers to know deeply about specifics topics than have superficial knowledge in a widely number of subjects.

## How this guide will work?
I will walk with you through a lot of free resources. You will have a list of topics to study, and after each topic, you will return to this material to see more examples and exercises to internalize the current topic.

If we do not find a good free resource about an important topic, I will create an article explain this topic with the necessary projects to understand such thing. :)

Our basics steps to study are:

1. Copy
2. Modify
3. Create

### 1. Copy
In this step, you will read the resource indicated to you and copy (typing) all the examples, one by one (without copy/paste), and also literally copy the extra examples and exercises from this guide.

### 2. Modify
Here you will return to the previous examples and modify something in the code. Make a copy of the files that you worked and figure out a way to improve/modify some characteristics in the current code.

### 3. Create
In this final step, you will create something new based in the previous topics and examples that you studied.

Stay calm that you will fully understand that methodology when we actually start with the practical articles.
