## Introduction
This is a practical guide that aims to teach a person with zero programming experience how to become a professional JavaScript developer/engineer.

More than JavaScript, we will go through a variety of topics that are necessary for all kind of (web) developers, like Software Engineering, Testing, Web Design, etc.

This knowledge will empower us to create professional applications and solid open source projects.

> If you are a book person, you can find the book version of this guide **[here]()**.

## Motivation
It is really hard to learn a new skill alone. One of the worst things about learn something by ourselves is the high probability of doing things in the wrong way, in a totally amateur way, without any help or anyone to show us "the right way" to do such tasks.

Another thing that is even more hard for any newbie in any new field is how to figure out what need to be learned, what are the basic skills that will give the biggest results (Pareto principle), and things like that.

I already started to learn some abilities by myself: drawing, music (guitar) and programming to name a few.

Looking back, I really don't know how I had the courage to start doing these activities, and I feel scared just to think how easy it is giving up to learn something new not because we don't have the capacity, but because the new topic to be learned is a whole new world, and this is definitely a scary and overwhelming thing.

To help people that want to join this amazing world of programming, I will do my best to flatten the path that needs to be traveled on that journey that will still be challenging, but I hope that a more feasible one.

I'm also traveling on this road, and one of the best ways to internalize any topic is to teach it to someone else, so this is another motivation for that project.

> The important thing is not the arrival, but the path traveled. **Enjoy the journey!**
