## About Git

- Git was created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) to help him handle the creation of the Linux Kernel.
- **Efficient**: has good algorithms to handle all the versioning system, keeping the files really small and the operations very fast.
- **Secure** uses SHA1 to recognize commits. It's almost impossible losing data using git.
- Is a distributed system based in **snapshots**.

## Installation

Just go to the [downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) page on Git official website and follow the instructions for your respective operating system.
